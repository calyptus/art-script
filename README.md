ART Script
==========
An ART Script file (.art.js) is a plain JavaScript file which uses ONLY the standard APIs
from the ART project on top of the standard ECMAScript 5 APIs. Each ART Script contains
a JavaScript class that can be used to instantiate a vector graphics component.

This project provides stub methods on top of an AST, that can be used to generate such files.
